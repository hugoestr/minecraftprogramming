# Create the Mob's body

So we need to create the body for our mob. So let's explore what the [API](MinecraftApISpec.html) give us.

We find that we can modify blocks with Minecraft. We also see that the API, at this point, doesn't allow us the capability to change the skin of the mob. This is a minor setback, and hopefully MOJANG will change this in the future, but in reality it doesn't matter much since most of what a mob does is behavior rather than looks.

So let's create another to do list, this time outlining what we need to create our mob's body

* Design the body 
* learn how to create a single cube
* How how to create a number of cubes to create a body

Our first design will be simple: our mob will consist in a column with three blocks.

Now we need to learn how to [create a single block](CreateSingleBlock.html).
