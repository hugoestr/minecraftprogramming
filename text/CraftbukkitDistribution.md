# Our craftbukkit distribution

We created a special craftbukkit distribution to make it easier to get started using the API. It has the RaspberryJuice plugin installed, the Minecraft API files installed, the server is already configured, and it contains a couple of scripts that makes it easy to start the server or a console to begin programming.

You will find the [distribution git hub repo][https://github.com/hugoestr/minecraftapipresentation)
